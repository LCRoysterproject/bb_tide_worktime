To answer your question about the Pressures, I got these explanations from the Diver Manual:

PH = P0 · exp[ –(M·g·H)/(R·T)]
where
PH = atmospheric pressure at elevation height H
P0 = atmospheric pressure at reference height
M = 28.8 · 10-3 kg/mol (molecular mass of air)
g = 9.81 m/s2
(standard gravity)
H = height in meters
R = 8.314 J/mol/K (gas constant)
T = temperature in Kelvin
